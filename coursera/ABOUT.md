#github.com/dasseclab/Coursera#

A place to put script and coursework for the class Python for Everybody via Coursera, presented by the University of Michigan. This repository is public-facing for my own convenience and perhaps to the amusement of anyone who stubles across it.

Scripts found in this repository are my work based on class assignments and should not be construed as anything other than classwork. Commentary on optimizing the code is appreciated.
