DKEY is a script to securely sanitize data from hard disk or solid state drives in various enterprise sizes. The method in which DKEY accomplishes sanitization is based upon, but still maintains compliance with, DoD-5220/CSEC-ITSG-06 (RCMP Standard).

Hardware controllers have limited support in first releases; if there is enough interest, I can pursue adding hardware controller support. Likewise, software controller support is going to work best with RAID 0 arrays, possibly RAID 1 or RAID 1+0 are the next steps.
