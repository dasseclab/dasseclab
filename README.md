Small Iteration Scripts and Other Software.

This github is for small projects and experiments, written by @dasseclab. Different projects will have different branches, natch. 

There are a variety of projects that I am drafting, all related to data/network/information security in nature. Check back for updates here on github or via the my security blog found at https://dasseclab.net.
